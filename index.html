                    Hello ! This is my portfolio. Hopefully it shows what I've made over the years. I've still got a ways to go, but I'm really proud of how far I've come.
                    <br><br>
                    I've always been a problem solver, and I've always loved to create. Game Dev is where those two meet for me.

                    I'm a first year student at Queen Mary University of London, studying Computer Science. The course is great and I'm learning alot. It's so great to finally be studying something so close to me.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, the goal is to end up making games. I've made a few steps towards it (this portfolio, for one) but there's alot to go. It's so daunting ! 
                    <br><br>
                    I spend alot of time thinking about how games tick, what makes them work. Both from like, the mechanical code perspective, and also from the design perspective (what makes the game fun.)

                    The dream is to work with someone like Toby Fox, or Edmund McMillen. Those two are real legends to me. There's loads of great designers in Japan too, but I don't speak the language... maybe someday I'll get to meet Hidetaka Miyazaki. Satoru Iwata was a hero to young me, and I still think about him all the time.
                    <br><br>
                    It looks like I've been pipe dreaming again.
