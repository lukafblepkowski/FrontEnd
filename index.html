                    Hello ! This is my portfolio. Hopefully it shows what I've made over the years. I've still got a ways to go, but I'm really proud of how far I've come.
                    <br><br>
                    I've always been a problem solver, and I've always loved to create. Game Dev is where those two meet for me.

                    I'm a first year student at Queen Mary University of London, studying Computer Science. The course is great and I'm learning a lot. It's so great to finally be studying something so close to me.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, the goal is to end up making games. I've made a few steps towards it (this portfolio, for one) but there's alot to go. It's so daunting ! 
                    <br><br>
                    I spend alot of time thinking about how games tick, what makes them work. Both from like, the mechanical code perspective, and also from the design perspective (what makes the game fun.)
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    The dream is to work with someone like Toby Fox, or Edmund McMillen. Those two are real legends to me. There's loads of great designers in Japan too, but I don't speak the language... maybe someday I'll get to meet Hidetaka Miyazaki. Satoru Iwata was a hero to young me, and I still think about him all the time.
                    <br><br>
                    It looks like I've been pipe dreaming again.

                        Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it ! It's a great, creative deckbuilder, with a unique theme and idea. I get that. It's a fun game. But I wasn't on the hype train for it as much as other people. People were talking about it as the best roguelike ever, when I wasn't sure it was even close. Sure it's good, but I didn't feel it had the depth that something like Slay The Spire or The Binding of Isaac has. I felt run after run, I was always incentivised to play one of a handful of strategies, and I was at the whims of the game to decide whether or not I ended up finding the jokers I needed for that strategy.
                        <br><br>
                        I, around that time, got really, really into drafting. I play alot of Magic, but draft was still relatively new to me. (To people who don't play Magic, draft is a format wherein you 'draft' cards out of a randomly selected pool to create a deck. Think Slay The Spire sort of thing.) Draft is a phenomenal format. As I got into it, I realised the depth there. It isn't just about taking the most powerful cards: Some cards are great, but only in some circumstances, while others might not be as good, but are more generically acceptable. The real genius comes when you realise you're competing with other people for those cards. Realising your opponents are drafting a certain strategy might incentivise you to draft away from that strategy, so you aren't stepping on each other's toes. Sometimes you'll take a card just because you think someone else would benefit from that card themself (This is called a "hate pick").

                        Point is, There's alot of depth to the order in which you pick your cards in a Draft, which isn't as evident to players when they start out. When I came back to balatro, I started thinking of it like a Draft. At which point, I really did fall in love. Some of the Jokers are so useless on their own, and so it might not be wise to take them immediately. Whereas others might set you up with more resources, which might allow you something in the future. And of course, some are good in the early game, but don't do as much later on. It really is well designed.

                        I realised also, that none of the Joker cards in Balatro introduce any new mechanics, and instead they just play around with the mechanics that the game already has (consumables, chips / mult, money, card attributes, etc). This means that Jokers are all focused around a few core ideas, and therefore they have a way higher chance of synergising with each other. The game feels so concise, and I don't think there are any Jokers that feel obsolete or unneeded.

                        I'm glad I came back to it, but it's still no Isaac.
